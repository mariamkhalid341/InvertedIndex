About
I currently lead the Department of Strategy, Marketing and Innovation. I also lead the Responsible Management and Business Ethics education within the Faculty.
My research interests include the general area of strategy and international business, currently focusing on business ethics and sustainability. I am working on projects on human rights and the multinational enterprise; the mining and oil industry impact on communities in Brazil, Nigeria, Ghana; developing sustainability reporting framework for mining companies in Russia; impact of ethics and stress on decision making; and purchasing behaviour and ethics.
I joined Kingston University in 1997 and my background is in financial management. I hold a PhD (International Business) from Royal Holloway, University of London, and have international professional experience in business education and management in Lebanon, Russia, Egypt, France and the UK.
I am a strong advocate of making a difference in people's lives through business education. Research student supervision
