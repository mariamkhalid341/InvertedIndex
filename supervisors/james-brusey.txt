Biography
James Brusey received his BApSc with distinction and PhD from RMIT University in 1996 and 2003, respectively. His PhD won the Australian Computer Science Association award for Best Thesis in 2004. He has over 15 years’ experience in the IT industry, part of which was as an independent consultant. More recently, he has worked as a Senior Research Associate at Cambridge University’s Institute for Manufacturing with funding from the Auto-ID Centre.
Since 2007, James has worked as a Senior Lecturer at Coventry University in wireless sensor networks and a Senior Research Fellow of the Cogent Computing Applied Research Centre. During this period, he has helped to establish Cogent as a world class research centre with a broad portfolio of successful, industry-sponsored projects related to wireless sensor projects. He was awarded a readership in Pervasive Computing in 2012 and a professorship in computer science in 2018.
His current research interests include exploring issues with the practical deployment of wireless sensor networks, thermal comfort in buildings and car cabins.
Vision Statement
We are seeing a revolution in the way we think about computing. No longer are computers necessarily unwieldy devices tied to their desk, tethered by power cords and network cabling. Nor are we anymore wedded to the mouse and keyboard for their user interface. The rise in ability and popularity of small mobile, wirelessly connected devices has changed for ever what we thought was possible.
Despite these advances, distributed sensing is only feasible for a limited set of applications and inferring knowledge from these sensors is a problem that we do not yet hold the complete solution to.
I want my research to form part of the solution – to enable inexpensive, reliable, long-lived wireless sensing that provide not just data, but meaningful and reliable high-level information”.
