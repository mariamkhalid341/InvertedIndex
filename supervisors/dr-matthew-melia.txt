About
I completed my undergraduate studies  in 2001 at the University of Aberdeen (Joint MA Hons English-Lit / History of Art) and I was awarded my PhD from Kingston ('Architecture and Cruelty in the Writings of Antonin Artaud, Samuel Beckett and Jean Genet') in 2007, which I am currently revisining for possible publication
I currently teach across film, media and English Llterature.
My current and ongoing research concentrates  on the work of both Stanley Kubrick and Ken Russell. I  focuson areas such as the unwritten production histories of A Clockwork Orange, and the unmade and unrealised films and projects of Ken Russell.
. I am currently on the advisory board/editorial committee for a book series forthcoming from Intellect on Unmade Films.
I am a working on an edited collection entitled The Films of Ken Russell,  (Edinburgh University Press, International Directors Series) to which I am also contributing a chapter, The Gothic Legacy of Ken Russell.
I am  on the advisory board/editorial committee for a book series forthcoming from Intellect on Unmade Films.
I spend a considerable amount of time in the Stanley Kubrick Archives  where I am also  carrying out resesarch for a book project based around production design and the production history of A Clockwork Orange. I presented this research at the 2019 SCMS conference in Seattle. 
In 2018 I  co-organized and led  on A Clockwork Orange entitled A Clockwork Symposium  in partnership with the Kubrick Archives / LCC, The International Anthony Burgess Foundation and Kingston University. 
In 2016 I organized and led a major conference,  Ken Russell: Perspectives Reception and Legacy  at Kingston University.
