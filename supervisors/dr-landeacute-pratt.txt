About
I lead the MSc in Project Management for Creative Practitioners and also teach both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the Department of Media and Communication at Kingston University.  I convene a range of applied, theory and practice based modules.  
Prior to Kingston, I project managed and co-produced the British Film Institute's flagship site screenonline.org.uk, a digital archive focusing on the history of British film and television.
I am a trained barrister as well as an industry focused creative practitioner. I currently have a research and consulting practice, which is art business management and creative industries focused, this includes working with creative licensing and acting as UK agent representing the work of Afro-pop artists and UK based contemporary artists, among others.
