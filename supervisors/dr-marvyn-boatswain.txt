I completed my PhD in Marketing at Kingston Business School, examining the impact of context and decoy effects on brand positioning and consumer perceptions. Other research interests include place branding, regulatory mode theory (RMT) in the B2B context, and student engagement and employability.

My research has been recently published in the Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing (2020). I am currently working on several projects targeted at prestigious journals.
