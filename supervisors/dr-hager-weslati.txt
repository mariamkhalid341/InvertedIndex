About
I am course director of the MA in Media and Communication and a core faculty member in the department of Journalism, Publishing and Media since 2010. I have also taught at Lancaster University, the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Tunis, and have been visiting senior research fellow in American studies at Indiana University Bloomington, and the New School, New York
I lead teaching on and contribute to the curriculum design of BA and MA modules on media events, mass and new media theory, social media and software studies, and strategic political communication My primary research interest is in critical theory and contemporary philosophy with a focus on the philosophy of information, psychoanalysis, and political communication.
My current work explores the manuscripts of Alexandre Kojève and their ideological translations in Western and Eastern (philosophical) thought around the notions of authority, legality, and power. Past projects include studies on spatial ordering after the end of history, theology after modern physics, the aesthetics of visual vacancy in film and contemporary art, and the role of women's travel writings in shaping modernist projects of transnational cultural governance
Current PhD supervision includes projects in progress on the semiotics of social media, the metaphysics of Palestinian cinema, the algorithm of authority, and manifestations of the ordinary psychosis in AI and new media technologies   
I welcome PhD proposals related or relevant to my areas of specialism.
