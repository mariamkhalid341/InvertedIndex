About
I am an artist-researcher in Media Arts and Digital Poetics and the Course Leader of the BA in Media and Communication.  My doctorate was one of the first practice-based research in the field of electronic poetry and language-art (2000-2003) and I have continued to explore the poetic space in hybrid textualities of language, art and digital technologies. My practice has been exhibited worldwide, and it is published in the ELC1 and the ELMCIP Anthology of European Electronic Literature. 
Prizes:

In May 2018, AHRC grant, 'Memory, Victims, and Representation of the Colombian Conflict' focusing on women's voices to collaborate with Prof Claire Taylor from Liverpool University and project partners from Grupo de Investigación COMBA I+D, Universidad Santiago de Cali, Universidad de Vigo, España- Pedagogical and Technological University. Other grants to conduct research at international institutions include:
Information Studies & Digital Design, School of Communication and Culture, Aarhus University, Denmark;
Laboratory: COSTECH Technologies and Human Sciences (TSH) Department, University of Technology of Compiegne (France);
Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) in Melbourne, Australia (AHRC Small Grants);
The University of Sydney, Australia (TIES Grant) and Media Research Lab -New York University, NY, USA (Promising Researcher Fellowship by Kingston University.
I am one of the team members of "Translating Electronic Literature: A Transatlantic Program in Collaborative Digital Humanities" (2017-2018), a research project funded by the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l'Homme (FMSH) and the Andrew Mellon Foundation.
I am frequently involved in international events, including keynote presentations and I have taken part in more than fifty conferences, curated exhibitions and led pedagogic, programming research clusters and research projects in collaborative practice.
I am one of the executive members of the Electronic Literature Organisation Board of Directors (ELO) and book editor for the "Electronic Literature" series with ELO- Bloomsbury Press. My practice-based research is at the intersection of language, art and digital technology. It explores inter-linguistic and multimodal digital textualities, digital media grammars, virtual poetic spaces and the reader's/viewer's engagement in an experience of shifting ‘in' and ‘out' of language by looking ‘at' and looking ‘through' transparent and abstract landscapes of text and linguistic soundscapes.
It draws from conceptual art, avant-garde poetics, remediating concepts of reading and writing (from the print, to the screen to installations spaces) and exploring digital media grammars (voice activation, use of webcam, use of mouse, acts of revealing, triggering, cut and paste, dragging) for interactivity, aesthetics, creation of virtual poetic spaces, engagement and meaning production.
It is trans-disciplinary, bringing together different cultural, artistic and literary traditions such as: fine art, linguistics, translation, visual, concrete and sound poetry, with digital poetics, electronic writing, creative programming, interaction and interface design, new media art theories and practices. My practice includes interactive digital media installations, performances, web-based works, sound-generated poems, interactive generative narratives and data visualisation poetics. The themes are varied with an interest in the relationship between experimentation, social issues, art and literature and I am very interested in producing site-specific pieces. Thus, my research outputs cover a selection of theory and practice as exemplified by the publications outlined. http://www.mariamencia.com/documents/MARIA%20MENCIA_publications.pdf
