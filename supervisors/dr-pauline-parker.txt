About
After completing my doctorate in 2015 I started lecturing at Kingston University. Having a background as an entrepreneur, consultant and senior manager in a large corporate I am able to bring theory into practice with real-world examples.
I have a proven record of adding value to software solution enterprises through innovation and intrepreneurship. As well as creating new business, I have mentored startups and entrepreneurs and has successfully managed global portfolio's from £200k up to £75m annual revenues.
My research reflects my product management passion following on from customer focused product development in software and the impacts of business change projects on innovation after mergers and acquisitions. My research focused on the effect of product integration on performance post acquisition:  Factors influencing the capture of value in the case of highly acquisitive firms in the business software industry.   An empirical study into firms' dynamic capabilities towards attainment of profitable product integration synergies post mergers and acquisition.
My current research encompasses the Agile impact on Innovation: The focus on agility has become a major change in the way products are managed and innovation is implemented, particularly in a technology environment. The concepts of an Agile organisation is to reduce waste and increase innovation, however the implantation to a new framework is often problematic.his research aims to identify the key factors associated with the implementation of Agile within an organisation and to assess the impact on innovation outputs.
