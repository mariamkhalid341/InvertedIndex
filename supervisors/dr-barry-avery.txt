About
I am an associate professor in the Accounting, Finance and Informatics department with the role of Director of Learning and Teaching, having taught in Kingston Business School for the last 21 years. Alongside my academic work, I also perform the occasional IT consultancy projects and have worked for companies such as Unilever and Thomson Reuters, as an analyst and programmer.
I recently completed my PhD at Lancaster University, which examines the use of Technology Enhanced Learning with Assessment. I was recently awarded a University Teaching Fellowship and this will feed-forward into my work on learning gain. Publications
